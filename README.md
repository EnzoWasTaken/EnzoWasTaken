Hello, I'm Enzo.

👩‍💻 I have an interest in coding, even if im not the most motivated sometime. I know a little of C++, C, LUAU (Roblox Language), Lua, Python, JS. 
      As impressive as that may seem, I only know the barebones of most besides LUAU. Ive made a few games on Roblox, none really ever make it to publishing.
      If you have any tips to provide me as to motivate myself. All would be Appreciative.
